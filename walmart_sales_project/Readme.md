# Welcome to the Walmart project!

![Walmart Logo]("/walmart_logo.png")

The data was collected from Kaggle using a Kaggle API key. I downloaded my API key as json file and I moved that json file into C:\users\your_user_name.kaggle\kaggle.json
The database that I used throughout this project was PostgreSQL.
My credentials for the database like (username, password, host, port, database_name) I stored into a .env file
You can find the necessary dependencies in the requirements.txt
